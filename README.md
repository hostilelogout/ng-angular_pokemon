# The Pokemon Catching Website

We have heard your cries! We understand your pain! After what can only be described as nothing short of the utter and complete disasters that were Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, we realized it was time to act!

We realized that it was absolutely time to, in fact, out-do GameFREAK on the disaster scale.

Enter the Pokémon catching simulator that makes you wish you had been a nice kid that one Christmas evening to not deserve this! That makes you wish your karma didn't weigh so heavy it tilts the Earth out of the summer season about 3 weeks too soon! That makes you appreciate that at least, if nothing else, Pokemon Sword and Shield had absolutely stellar gym battle themes to headbang to while the pandemic cancelled all surrounding concerts!

(But hey, at least we got the full national dex.)

## Installation

This marvelous masterpiece of monstrous magnitude must magically maintain a presence on a provided URL!

## Description

Scour through a catalogue of pixel monsters that grow increasingly bizzare in design by the RIGHT-click! Catch'em'all if you're bored enough out of your mind and are helplessly out of paint to watch dry! Admire your progress on a profile page so fragile that a Bulbasaur's natural breeze endagers the entire species! So, please, for the love of all. Do. Not. Sneeze.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Sean Skinner, for being a great teacher and speaker, able to drill Angular fundamentals into our minds where there was no prior knowledge of any of the topics whatsoever. These words are causing severe symptoms of deja vu at this point.

My coffee cup, for being my coffee cup.

My other coffee cup, for not being my first coffee cup.
